At a national level, this process \nrequires the identiﬁcation of risk factors associated with money laundering \nand terrorist ﬁnancing threats and vulnerabilities. Threats are a function of the \ngeneral levels of criminal and terrorist activity to which a country is exposed. \nVulnerabilities are a function of political (the characteristics of the political \nsystem), economic (the nature of economic activity), social (demographic \ncharacteristics), technological (level of technological advancement), \nenvironmental (issues related to the physical environment), and legislative \n(the coverage, maturity, and effectiveness of the legislative system) factors. \nAssessing the risk\nThe identiﬁcation or recognition of risk is the ﬁrst step in an effective risk \nmanagement process. Beyond identifying risk, it is equally important to \nmeasure or quantify risk. Unless it is effectively measured, it is difficult to \nassess the potential impact that a given type or source of risk can have on an \ninstitution. NBFIs should therefore develop techniques and mechanisms that \nwill allow them to assess the quantum of each type of money laundering and \nterrorist ﬁnancing risk with which it is faced and the likely duration of such risk. \nIf, for example, an NBFI considers a speciﬁc type of customer to represent a \nhigh money laundering or terrorist ﬁnancing risk, then it should at all times be \naware of the number of such customers it has and the types and volume of \nbusiness activity and transactions they are conducting.\nManaging the risk\nHaving identiﬁed and measured risks, NBFIs should develop a risk \nmanagement framework and practices to effectively mitigate such risks. This \nrequires the development of policies that reﬂect the institution’s risk appetite \nand its approach to risk management, procedures that give effect to the \npolicies, and limits that preclude undesirable levels of risk concentrations or \nexposures. \nAn important aspect of a framework for controlling risk is the establishment \nof clear lines of authority and reporting lines and responsibilities. Effective \ncontrol of risk is also dependent on the institution’s ability to communicate its \npolicies, procedures, and limits to all employees and business units involved in \nthe management of money laundering and terrorist ﬁnancing risks.",

NBFIs should therefore have management information system \n(MIS) that measures their inherent money laundering and terrorist ﬁnancing \nrisks and changes in such exposures. In the context of money laundering and \nterrorist ﬁnancing risks, it is important, for example, that the MIS monitors the \nincrease or decrease of the NBFI’s exposure to such risk. The MIS should also, \nfor example, monitor customer behavior and transactions to identify activity \nthat may arouse suspicion of being linked to money laundering or terrorist \nﬁnancing. \nFurther, the MIS should monitor the adherence to established policies and \nprocedures to determine, for example, when an established internal limit or \nlegal and regulatory obligations have been breached.
