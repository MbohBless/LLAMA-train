A strong and resilient banking system is the foundation for sustainable economic \ngrowth, as banks are at the centre of the cr edit intermediation process between savers and \ninvestors. Moreover, banks provide critical services to consumers, small and medium-sized \nenterprises, large corporate firms and governments who rely on them to conduct their daily \nbusiness, both at a domestic and international level. 4. One of the main reasons the economic and financial crisis, which began in 2007, \nbecame so severe was that the banking sectors of many countries had built up excessive on- \nand off-balance sheet leverage. This was accompanied by a gradual erosion of the level and \nquality of the capital base. At the same time, many banks were holding insufficient liquidity \nbuffers. The banking system therefore was not able to absorb the resulting systemic trading \nand credit losses nor could it cope with the reintermediation of large off-balance sheet \nexposures that had built up in the shadow banking system. The crisis was further amplified \nby a procyclical deleveraging process and by t he interconnectedness of systemic institutions \nthrough an array of complex transactions. During the most severe episode of the crisis, the \nmarket lost confidence in the solvency and liquidity of many banking institutions. The \nweaknesses in the banking sector were rapidly transmitted to the rest of the financial system \nand the real economy, resulting in a massive contraction of liquidity and credit availability.",

The effect on banks, financial systems and economies at the epicentre of the crisis \nwas immediate. However, the crisis also spread to a wider circle of countries around the \nglobe. For these countries the transmission channels were less direct, resulting from a \nsevere contraction in global liquidity, cross-border credit availability and demand for exports. Given the scope and speed with which the recent and previous crises have been transmitted \naround the globe as well as the unpredictable nature of future crises, it is critical that all \ncountries raise the resilience of their banking sectors to both internal and external shocks. 6. To address the market failures revealed by the crisis, the Committee is introducing a \nnumber of fundamental reforms to the international regulatory framework. The reforms \nstrengthen bank-level, or microprudential, regulation, which will help raise the resilience of \nindividual banking institutions to periods of stress. The reforms also have a macroprudential \nfocus, addressing system-wide risks that can build up across the banking sector as well as \nthe procyclical amplification of these risks over time. Clearly these micro and \nmacroprudential approaches to supervision are interrelated, as greater resilience at the \nindividual bank level reduces the risk of system-wide shocks. A.",

The \ncrisis demonstrated that credit losses and writedowns come out of retained earnings, which \nis part of banks’ tangible common equity base. It also revealed the inconsistency in the \ndefinition of capital across jurisdictions and the lack of disclosure that would have enabled \nthe market to fully assess and compare the quality of capital between institutions. 9. To this end, the predominant form of Tier 1 capital must be common shares and \nretained earnings. This standard is reinforced through a set of principles that also can be \ntailored to the context of non-joint stock companies to ensure they hold comparable levels of \nhigh quality Tier 1 capital. Deductions from capital and prudential filters have been \nharmonised internationally and generally applied at the level of common equity or its \nequivalent in the case of non-joint stock companies. The remainder of the Tier 1 capital base \nmust be comprised of instruments that are subordinated, have fully discretionary non-\ncumulative dividends or coupons and have neither a maturity date nor an incentive to \nredeem. Innovative hybrid capital instruments with an incentive to redeem through features \nsuch as step-up clauses, currently limited to 15% of the Tier 1 capital base, will be phased \nout. In addition, Tier 2 capital instruments will be harmonised and so-called Tier 3 capital \ninstruments, which were only available to cover market risks, eliminated.

The enhanced treatment introduces a stressed value-at-risk \n(VaR) capital requirement based on a continuous 12-month period of significant financial \nstress. In addition, the Committee has introduced higher capital requirements for so-called \nresecuritisations in both the banking and the trading book.

They also \nprovide incentives to strengthen the risk management of counterparty credit exposures. 14. To this end, the Committee is introducing the following reforms: \n(a) Going forward, banks must determine their capital requirement for counterparty \ncredit risk using stressed inputs.

The approach, which is similar to what has been introduced for market \nrisk, will also promote more integrated management of market and counterparty \ncredit risk.

While the Basel II standard covers the risk of a \ncounterparty default, it does not address such CVA risk, which during the financial \ncrisis was a greater source of losses than those arising from outright defaults. (c) The Committee is strengthening standards for collateral management and initial \nmargining.

One of the underlying features of the cr isis was the build up of excessive on- an d\n \noff-balance sheet leverage in the banking system. The build up of leverage also has been a \nfeature of previous financial crises, for example leading up to September 1998. During the \nmost severe part of the crisis, the banking sector was forced by the market to reduce its \nleverage in a manner that amplified downward pressure on asset prices, further exacerbating \nthe positive feedback loop between losses, declines in bank capital, and the contraction in \ncredit availability. The Committee therefore is introducing a leverage ratio requirement that is \nintended to achieve the following objectives: \n constrain leverage in the banking sector, thus helping to mitigate the risk of the \ndestabilising deleveraging processes wh ich can damage the financial system and \nthe economy; and  \n introduce additional safeguards against model risk and measurement error by \nsupplementing the risk-based measure with a simple, transparent, independent \nmeasure of risk. 17.

One of the most destabilising elements of the crisis has been the procyclical \namplification of financial shocks throughout the banking system, financial markets and the \nbroader economy. The tendency of market participants to behave in a procyclical manner \nhas been amplified through a variety of channels, including through accounting standards for \nboth mark-to-market assets and held-to-maturity loans, margining practices, and through the \nbuild up and release of leverage among financial institutions, firms, and consumers. The \nBasel Committee is introducing a number of measures to make banks more resilient to such \nprocyclical dynamics. These measur es will help ensure that the banking sector serves as a \nshock absorber, instead of a transmitter of risk to the financial system and broader economy. 19. In addition to the leverage ratio discussed in the previous section, the Committee is \nintroducing a series of measures to address procyclicality and raise the resilience of the \nbanking sector in good times. These measures have the following key objectives: \n dampen any excess cyclicality of the minimum capital requirement; \n promote more forward looking provisions; \n conserve capital to build buffers at individual banks and the banking sector that can \nbe used in stress; and \n achieve the broader macroprudential goal of protecting the banking sector from \nperiods of excess credit growth. Cyclicality of the minimum requirement \n20. The Basel II framework increased the risk sensit ivity and coverage of the regulatory \ncapital requ\nirement. Indeed, one of the most procyclical dynamics has been the failure of risk \nmanagement and capital frameworks to capture key exposures – such as complex trading \nactivities, resecuritisations and exposures to of f-balance sheet vehicles – in advance of the \ncrisis. However, it is not possible to achieve gr eater risk sensitivity across institutions at a \ngiven point in time without introducing a certain degree of cyclicality in minimum capital \nrequirements over time. The Committee was aware of this trade-off during the design of the \nBasel II framework and introduced a number of safeguards to address excess cyclicality of \nthe minimum requirement. They include the requirement to use long term data horizons to \nestimate probabilities of default, the introduction of so called downturn loss-given-default \n(LGD) estimates and the appropriate calibration of the risk functions, which convert loss \nestimates into regulatory capital requirements. The Committee also required that banks \nconduct stress tests that consider the downward migration of their credit portfolios in a \nrecession.",

It has issued publicly and made available to the \nIASB a set of high level guiding principles that should govern the reforms to the replacement \nof IAS 39. 6 The Committee supports an EL approach that captures actual losses more \ntransparently and is also less procyclical than the current “incurred loss” approach. 24.

Third, it is addressing incentives to stronger provisioning in the regulatory capital \nframework. Capital conservation \n26. The Committee is introducing a framework to promote the conservation of capital \nand the build-up of adequate buffer\ns above the minimum that can be drawn down in periods \nof stress. 27. At the onset of the financial crisis, a number of banks continued to make large \ndistributions in the form of dividends, share buy backs and generous compensation \npayments even though their individual financial condition and the outlook for the sector were \ndeteriorating. Much of this activity was driven by a collective action problem, where \nreductions in distributions were perceived as sending a signal of weakness. However, these \nactions made individual banks and the sector as a whole less resilient. Many banks soon \nreturned to profitability but did not do enough to rebuild their capital buffers to support new \nlending activity. Taken together, this dynamic has increased the procyclicality of the system. 28. To address this market failure, the Committee is introducing a framework that will \ngive supervisors stronger tools to promote capital conservation in the banking sector. Implementation of the framework through internationally agreed capital conservation \nstandards will help increase sector resilience going into a downturn and will provide the \nmechanism for rebuilding capital during the economic recovery.

B. Introducing a global  liquidity standard \n34. Strong capital requirements are a necessary condition for banking sector stability \nbut by themselves are not sufficient. A strong liquidity base reinforced through robust \nsupervisory standards is of equal importance. To date, however, there have been no \ninternationally harmonised standards in this area. The Basel Committee is therefore \nintroducing internationally harmonised global liquidity standards. As with the global capital \nstandards, the liquidity standards will establish minimum requirements and will promote an \ninternational level playing field to help prevent a competitive race to the bottom. 35. During the early “liquidity phase” of the financial crisis, many banks – despite \nadequate capital levels – still experienced difficulties because they did not manage their \nliquidity in a prudent manner. The crisis again drove home the importance of liquidity to the \nproper functioning of financial markets and the banking sector. Prior to the crisis, asset \nmarkets were buoyant and funding was readily available at low cost. The rapid reversal in \nmarket conditions illustrated how quickly liquidity can evaporate and that illiquidity can last for \nan extended period of time. The banking system came under severe stress, which \nnecessitated central bank action to support both the functioning of money markets and, in \nsome cases, individual institutions. 36. The difficulties experienced by some banks were due to lapses in basic principles of \nliquidity risk management. In re sponse, as the foundation of its liquidity framework, the \nCommittee in 2008 published Principles for Sound Liquidity Risk Management and \nSupervision.7 The Sound Principles provide detailed guidance on the risk management and \nsupervision of funding liquidity risk and should help promote better risk management in this \ncritical area, but only if there is full implementation by banks and supervisors. As such, the \nCommittee will coordinate rigorous follow up by supervisors to ensure that banks adhere to \nthese fundamental principles. 37. To complement these principles, the Committee has further strengthened its liquidity \nframework by developing two minimum standards for funding liquidity. An additional \ncomponent of the liquidity framework is a set of monitoring metrics to improve cross-border \nsupervisory consistency. 38.",

Liquidity Coverage Ratio  \n40. The LCR is intended to promote resilience to potential liqui dity disruptions over \na \nthirty day horizon. It will help ensure that global banks have sufficient unencumbered, high-\nquality liquid assets to offset the net cash outflows it could encounter under an acute short-\nterm stress scenario. The specified scenario is  built upon circumstances experienced in the \nglobal financial crisis that began in 2007 and entails both institution-specific and systemic \nshocks. The scenario entails a significant stress, albeit not a worst-case scenario, and \nassumes the following: \n a significant downgrade of the institution’s public credit rating;  \n a partial loss of deposits; \n a loss of unsecured wholesale funding; \n a significant increase in secured funding haircuts; and  \n increases in derivative collateral calls and substantial calls on contractual and non-\ncontractual off-balance sheet exposures, including committed credit and liquidity \nfacilities. 41. High-quality liquid assets held in the stock should be unencumbered, liquid in \nmarkets during a time of stress and, ideally, be central bank eligible. 2. Net Stable Funding Ratio \n42. The NSFR requires a minimum am ount of st\nable sources of funding at a bank \nrelative to the liquidity profiles of the assets, as well as the potential for contingent liquidity \nneeds arising from off-balance sheet commitments, over a one-year horizon. The NSFR aims \nto limit over-reliance on short-term wholesale funding during times of buoyant market liquidity \nand encourage better assessment of liquidity risk across all on- and off-balance sheet items. 3.",

One area in particular where \nmore work on monitoring tools will be conducted relates to intraday liquidity risk. (a) Contractual maturity mismatch: To gain an understanding of the basic aspects of a \nbank’s liquidity needs, banks should frequently conduct a contractual maturity mismatch \nassessment. This metric provides an initial, simple baseline of contractual commitments and \nis useful in comparing liquidity risk profiles across institutions, and to highlight to both banks \nand supervisors when potential liquidity needs could arise. (b) Concentration of funding: This metric involves analysing concentrations of wholesale \nfunding provided by specific counterparties, instruments and currencies. A metric covering \nconcentrations of wholesale funding assists supervisors in assessing the extent to which \nfunding liquidity risks could occur in the event that one or more of the funding sources are \nwithdrawn. (c) Available unencumbered assets: This metric measures the amount of \nunencumbered assets a bank has which could potentially be used as collateral for secured \nfunding either in the market or at standing central bank facilities. This should make banks \n(and supervisors) more aware of their potential capacity to raise additional secured funds, \nkeeping in mind that in a stressed situation this ability may decrease. (d) LCR by currency: In recognition that foreign exchange risk is a component of \nliquidity risk, the LCR should also be assessed in each significant currency, in order to \nmonitor and manage the overall level and trend of currency exposure at a bank. (e) Market-related monitoring tools: In order to have a source of instantaneous data on \npotential liquidity difficulties, useful data to monitor includes market-wide data on asset prices \nand liquidity, institution-related information such as credit default swap (CDS) spreads and \nequity prices, and additional institution-specific information related to the ability of the \ninstitution to fund itself in various wholesale funding markets and the price at which it can do \nso.

Revised metric to better address counterparty credit risk, credit valuation \nadjustments and wrong-way risk \nEffective EPE with stressed parameters to address general wrong-way risk \n98. In order to implement these changes, a new paragraph 25(i) will be inserted in \nSection V (Internal Model Method: measuring exposure and minimum requirements), Annex \n4, of the Basel II framework and the existing paragraph 61 of Annex 4\n will be revised as \nfollows for banks with permission to use the internal models method (IMM) to calculate \ncounterparty credit risk (CCR) regulatory capital – hereafter referred to as “IMM banks”: \n25(i). To determine the default risk capital charge for counterparty credit risk as \ndefined in paragraph 105, banks must use the greater of the portfolio-level capital \ncharge (not including the CVA charge in paragraphs 97-104) based on Effective \nEPE using current market data and the portfolio-level capital charge based on \nEffective EPE using a stress calibration. The stress calibration should be a single \nconsistent stress calibration for the whole portfolio of counterparties. The greater of \nEffective EPE using current market data and the stress calibration should not be \napplied on a counterparty by counterparty basis, but on a total portfolio level. 61. When the Effective EPE model is calibra ted using historic market data, the \nbank must employ current market data to compute current exposures and at least \nthree years of historical data must be used to estimate parameters of the model. Alternatively, market implied data may be used to estimate parameters of the model. In all cases, the data must be updated quarterly or more frequently if market \nconditions warrant. To calculate the Effective EPE using a stress calibration, the \nbank must also calibrate Effective EPE using three years of data that include a \nperiod of stress to the credit default spreads of a bank’s counterparties or calibrate \nEffective EPE using market implied data from a suitable period of stress. The \nfollowing process will be used to assess the adequacy of the stress calibration: \n The bank must demonstrate, at least quarterly, that the stress period \ncoincides with a period of increased CDS or other credit spreads – such as \nloan or corporate bond spreads – for a representative selection of the \nbank’s counterparties with traded credit spreads. In situations where the \nbank does not have adequate credit spread data for a counterparty, the \nbank should map each counterparty to specific credit spread data based on \nregion, internal rating and business types.  The exposure model for all counterparties must use data, either historic or \nimplied, that include the data from the stressed credit period, and must use \nsuch data in a manner consistent with the method used for the calibration \nof the Effective EPE model to current data.  To evaluate the effectiveness of its st ress calibration for Effective EPE, the \nbank must create several benchmark portfolios that are vulnerable to the \nsame main risk factors to which the bank is exposed. The exposure to \nthese benchmark portfolios shall be calculated using (a) current positions at \ncurrent market prices, stressed volatilities, stressed correlations and other \nrelevant stressed exposure model inputs from the 3-year stress period and \n(b) current positions at end of stress period market prices, stressed \nvolatilities, stressed correlations and other relevant stressed exposure \nmodel inputs from the 3-year stress period. Supervisors may adjust the \nstress calibration if the exposures of these benchmark portfolios deviate \nsubstantially.

In addition to the default risk capital requirements for counterparty credit risk \ndetermined based on the standardised or internal ratings-based (IRB) approaches \nfor credit risk, a bank must add a capital charge to cover the risk of mark-to-market \nlosses on the expected counterparty risk (such losses being known as credit value \nadjustments, CVA) to OTC derivatives.

A bank is \nnot required to include in this capital charge (i) transactions with a central \ncounterparty (CCP); and (ii) securities financing transactions (SFT), unless their \nsupervisor determines that the bank’s CVA loss exposures arising from SFT \ntransactions are material.

This VaR model is restricted to changes in the \ncounterparties’ credit spreads and does not model the sensitivity of CVA to changes \nin other market factors, such as changes in the value of the reference asset, \ncommodity, currency or interest rate of a derivative.

Only hedges used for the purpose of mitigating CVA risk, and managed as \nsuch, are eligible to be included in the VaR model used to calculate the above CVA \ncapital charge or in the standardised CVA risk capital charge set forth in paragraph \n104.

Other types of counterparty risk hedges must not be reflected within the calculation \nof the CVA capital charge, and these other hedges must be treated as any other \ninstrument in the bank’s inventory for regulatory capital purposes.

Subject to the completion of the revision of the CPSS-IOSCO standards, which cover, among \nother things, the risk management of a CCP, the Committee will apply a regulatory capital \ntreatment for exposures to CCPs based in part on the compliance of the CCP with the \nenhanced CPSS-IOSCO standards.

The current Basel II requirements for backtesting will be replaced with the following: \n42. It is important that supervisory authorities are able to assure themselves \nthat banks using models have counterparty credit risk management systems that are \nconceptually sound and implemented with integrity. Accordingly the supervisory \nauthority will specify a number of qualitative criteria that banks would have to meet \nbefore they are permitted to use a models-based approach. The extent to which \nbanks meet the qualitative criteria may influence the level at which supervisory \nauthorities will set the multiplication factor referred to in paragraph 32 (Alpha) above. Only those banks in full compliance with the qualitative criteria will be eligible for \napplication of the minimum multiplication factor. The qualitative criteria include: \n The bank must conduct a regular programme of backtesting, ie an ex-post \ncomparison of the risk measures 45 generated by the model against realised \nrisk measures, as well as comparing hypothetical changes based on static \npositions with realised measures.  The bank must carry out an initial validation and an on-going periodic \nreview of its IMM model and the risk measures generated by it. The \nvalidation and review must be independent of the model developers.  The board of directors and senior management should be actively involved \nin the risk control process and must regard credit and counterparty credit \nrisk control as an essential aspect of the business to which significant \nresources need to be devoted. In this regard, the daily reports prepared by \nthe independent risk control unit must be reviewed by a level of \nmanagement with sufficient seniority and authority to enforce both \nreductions of positions taken by individual traders and reductions in the \nbank’s overall risk exposure.  The bank’s internal risk measurement exposure model must be closely \nintegrated into the day-to-day risk management process of the bank. Its \noutput should accordingly be an integral part of the process of planning, \nmonitoring and controlling the bank’s counterparty credit risk profile.  The risk measurement system should be used in conjunction with internal \ntrading and exposure limits. In this regard, exposure limits should be \nrelated to the bank’s risk measurement model in a manner that is \nconsistent over time and that is well understood by traders, the credit \nfunction and senior management.  Banks should have a routine in place for ensuring compliance with a \ndocumented set of internal policies, controls and procedures concerning \nthe operation of the risk measurement system. The bank’s risk \nmeasurement system must be well documented, for example, through a \nrisk management manual that describes the basic principles of the risk \nmanagement system and that provides an explanation of the empirical \ntechniques used to measure counterparty credit risk.  An independent review of the risk measurement system should be carried \nout regularly in the bank’s own internal auditing process.

National supervisory authorities may, however, allow banks to use unsolicited \nratings in the same way as solicited ratings if they are satisfied that the credit \nassessments of unsolicited ratings are not inferior in quality to the general quality of \nsolicited ratings. However, there may be the potential for ECAIs to use unsolicited \nratings to put pressure on entities to obtain solicited ratings. Such behaviour, when \nidentified, should cause supervisors to consider whether to continue recognising \nsuch ECAIs as eligible for capital adequacy purposes. III. Capital conservation buffer \n122. This section outlines the operation of the capital conservation buffer, which is \ndesigned to ensure that banks build up capital buffers outside periods of stress which can be \ndrawn down as losses are incurred. The requirement is based on simple capital conservation \nrules designed to avoid breaches of minimum capital requirements. A. Capital conservation best practice \n123. Outside of periods of stress,  ban\nks should hold buffers of capital above the \nregulatory minimum. 124. When buffers have been drawn down, one way banks should look to rebuild them is \nthrough reducing discretionary distributions of earnings. This could include reducing dividend \npayments, share-backs and staff bonus payments. Banks may also choose to raise new \ncapital from the private sector as an alternative to conserving internally generated capital.

It is clear that greater efforts should be made to rebuild buffers the more they have \nbeen depleted. Therefore, in the absence of raising capital in the private sector, the share of \nearnings retained by banks for the purpose of rebuilding their capital buffers should increase \nthe nearer their actual capital levels are to the minimum capital requirement. 126. It is not acceptable for banks which have depleted their capital buffers to use future \npredictions of recovery as justification for maintaining generous distributions to shareholders, \nother capital providers and employees. These stakeholders, rather than depositors, must \nbear the risk that recovery will not be forthcoming. 127. It is also not acceptable for banks which have depleted their capital buffers to try \nand use the distribution of capital as a way to signal their financial strength. Not only is this \nirresponsible from the perspective of an individual bank, putting shareholders interests above \ndepositors, it may also encourage other banks to follow suit. As a consequence, banks in \naggregate can end up increasing distributions at the exact point in time when they should be \nconserving earnings. 128. The framework reduces the discretion of banks which have depleted their capital \nbuffers to further reduce them through generous distributions of earnings. In doing so, the \nframework will strengthen their ability to wi thstand adverse environments. Implementation of \nthe framework through internationally agreed c apital conservation rules will help increase \nsector resilience both going into a downturn, and provide the mechanism for rebuilding \ncapital during the early stages of economic recovery. Retaining a greater proportion of \nearnings during a downturn will help ensure that capital remains available to support the \nongoing business operations of banks through the period of stress.

Introduction  \n136. Losses incurred in the banking sector can be extremely large when a downturn is \npreceded by a period of excess credit growth. These losses can destabilise the banking \nsector and spark a vicious circle, whereby problems in the financial system can contribute to \na downturn in the real economy that then feeds back on to the banking sector. These \ninteractions highlight the particular importance of the banking sector building up additional \ncapital defences in periods where the risks of system-wide stress are growing markedly. 137. The countercyclical buffer aims to ensure that banking sector capital requirements \ntake account of the macro-financial environment in which banks operate. It will be deployed \nby national jurisdictions when excess aggregate credit growth is judged to be associated with \na build-up of system-wide risk to ensure the banking system has a buffer of capital to protect \nit against future potential losses. This focus on excess aggregate credit growth means that \njurisdictions are likely to only need to deploy the buffer on an infrequent basis. The buffer for \ninternationally-active banks will be a weighted average of the buffers deployed across all the \njurisdictions to which it has credit exposures. This means that they will likely find themselves \nsubject to a small buffer on a more frequent basis, since credit cycles are not always highly \ncorrelated across jurisdictions. 138. The countercyclical buffer regime consists of the following elements: \n(a) National authorities will monitor credit growth and other indicators that may signal a \nbuild up of system-wide risk and make asse ssments of whether credit growth is \nexcessive and is leading to the build up of system-wide risk. Based on this \nassessment they will put in place a countercyclical buffer requirement when \nNote: Basel III revisions published in December 2017 affect parts of this publication. https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.htm",

One of the underlying features of the crisis was the build-up of excessive on- and \noff-balance sheet leverage in the banking system . In many cases, banks built up excessive \nleverage while still showing strong risk based capital ratios. During the most severe part of \nthe crisis, the banking sector was forced by the market to reduce its leverage in a manner \nthat amplified downward pressure on asset prices, further exacerbating the positive feedback \nloop between losses, declines in bank capital, and contraction in credit availability. 152. Therefore, the Committee agreed to introduce a simple, transparent, non-risk based \nleverage ratio that is calibrated to act as a cr edible supplementary measure to the risk based \ncapital requirements. The leverage ratio is intended to achieve the following objectives: \n constrain the build-up of leverage in the banking sector, helping avoid destabilising \ndeleveraging processes which can damage the broader financial system and the \neconomy; and \n reinforce the risk based requirements with a simple, non-risk based “backstop” \nmeasure. B. Definition and calculation of the leverage ratio \n153. This section presents the definitio n and calculation of\n the leverage ratio, which \nwould serve as the basis for testing during the parallel run period. The basis of calculation is \nthe average of the monthly leverage ratio over the quarter based on the definitions of capital \n(the capital measure) and total exposure (the exposure measure) specified in paragraphs \n154 to 164. The Committee will test a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 3% during the parallel \nrun period from 1 January 2013 to 1 January 2017. Additional transitional arrangements are \nset out in paragraphs 165 to 167.",

The Committee also will \ncollect data during the transition period to track the impact of using total regulatory capital \nand Common Equity Tier 1. 155. Items that are deducted completely from capital do not contribute to leverage, and \nshould therefore also be deducted from the measure of exposure. That is, the capital and \nexposure should be measured consistently and  should avoid double counting. This means \nthat deductions from Tier 1 capital (as set out  in paragraphs 66 to 89) should also be made \nfrom the exposure measure. 156. According to the treatment outlined in paragraphs 84 to 89, where a financial entity \nis included in the accounting consolidation but not in the regulatory consolidation, the \ninvestments in the capital of these entities are required to be deducted to the extent that that \nthey exceed certain thresholds. To ensure that the capital and exposure are measured \nconsistently for the purposes of the leverage ratio, the assets of such entities included in the \naccounting consolidation should be excluded from  the exposure measure in proportion to the \ncapital that is excluded under paragraphs 84 to 89.

The exposure measure for the leverage ratio sh\nould generally follow the accounting \nmeasure of exposure. To be measured consistently with financial accounts, the following \nshould apply:  \n on-balance sheet, non-derivative exposures are net of specific provisions and \nvaluation adjustments (eg credit valuation adjustments); \n physical or financial collateral, guarantees or credit risk mitigation purchased is not \nallowed to reduce on-balance sheet exposures; and \n netting of loans and deposits is not allowed. (ii)  On-balance sheet items \n158. Banks should include item s using th\neir accounting balance sheet for the purposes of \nthe leverage ratio. In addition, the exposure measure should include the following treatments \nfor Securities Financing Transactions (SFT)54 and derivatives. (a)  Repurchase agreements and securities finance \n159. SFT are a form of secured funding and therefor e an important source \nof balance \nsheet leverage that should be included in the leverage ratio. Therefore, banks should \ncalculate SFT for the purposes of the leverage ratio by applying:  \n the accounting measure of exposure; and \n the regulatory netting rules based on the Basel II Framework. 55  \n(b)  Derivatives \n160. Derivatives create two types of exposure: an “on-balance sheet” present value \nreflecting th\ne fair value of the contract (often zero at outset but subsequently positive or \nnegative depending on the performance of the contract), and a notional economic exposure \nrepresenting the underlying economic interest of the contract. 161. Banks should calculate derivatives, including where a bank sells protection using a \ncredit derivative, for the purposes of the leverage ratio by applying:  \n the accounting measure of exposure plus an add-on for potential future exposure \ncalculated according to the Current Exposure Method as identified in paragraphs \n186, 187 and 317 of the Basel II Framework. This ensures that all derivatives are \nconverted in a consistent manner to a “loan equivalent” amount; and \n the regulatory netting rules based on the Basel II Framework. 56 \n                                                 \n54  Securities Financing Transactions are transactio ns such as repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase \nagreements, security lending and borrowing, and marg in lending transactions, where the value of the \ntransactions depends on the market valuations and the transactions are often subject to margin agreements. 55   Excepting the rules for cross-product netting in Annex 4, section 3.",

The \nCommittee will use  the\n transition period to monitor banks’ leverage data on a semi-annual \nbasis in order to assess whether the proposed design and calibration of the minimum Tier 1 \nleverage ratio of 3% is appropriate over a full credit cycle and for different types of business \nmodels. This assessment will include consideration of whether a wider definition of \nexposures and an offsetting adjustment in the ca libration would better achieve the objectives \nof the leverage ratio. The Committee also will closely monitor accounting standards and \npractices to address any differences in national accounting frameworks that are material to \nthe definition and calculation of the leverage ratio. 166. The transition period will comprise of a supervisory monitoring period and a parallel \nrun period:  \n The supervisory monitoring period commences 1 January 2011. The supervisory \nmonitoring process will focus on developing templates to track in a consistent \nmanner the underlying components of the agreed definition and resulting ratio.  The parallel run period commences 1 January 2013 and runs until 1 January 2017. During this period, the leverage ratio and its components will be tracked, including \nits behaviour relative to the risk based requirement. Banks are required to calculate \ntheir leverage ratio using the definitions of capital and total exposure specified in \nparagraphs 154 to 164 and their risk based capital requirement. Bank level \ndisclosure of the leverage ratio and its components will start 1 January 2015.57 The \nCommittee will develop a disclosure template and closely monitor disclosure of the \nratio. 167. Based on the results of the parallel run period, any final adjustments to the definition \nand calibration of the leverage ratio will be carried out in the first half of 2017, with a view to \nmigrating to a Pillar 1 treatment on 1 January 2018 based on appropriate review and \ncalibration. 57 Consistent with the scope of application as defined in paragraph 22 of the Basel II Framework.

This Annex is meant to clarify the calculation of the 15% limit on significant \ninvestments in the common shares of unconsolidated financial institutions (banks, insurance \nand other financial entities); mortgage servicing rights, and deferred tax assets arising from \ntemporary differences (collectively referred to as specified items). 2. The recognition of these specified items will be limited to 15% of Common Equity \nTier 1 (CET1) capital, after the application of all deductions. To determine the maximum \namount of the specified items that can be recognised*, banks and supervisors should \nmultiply the amount of CET1** (after all deductions, including after the deduction of the \nspecified items in full) by 17.65%. This number is derived from the proportion of 15% to 85% \n(ie 15%/85% = 17.65%). 3. As an example, take a bank with €85 of common equity (calculated net of all \ndeductions, including after the deduction of the specified items in full). 4. The maximum amount of specified items that can be recognised by this bank in its \ncalculation of CET1 capital is €85 x 17.65% = €15. Any excess above €15 must be deducted \nfrom CET1. If the bank has specified items (excluding amounts deducted after applying the \nindividual 10% limits) that in aggregate sum up to the 15% limit, CET1 after inclusion of the \nspecified items, will amount to €85 + €15 = €100. The percentage of specified items to total \nCET1 would equal 15%. * The actual amount that will be recognised may be lower than this maximum, either because the sum \nof the three specified items are bel ow the 15% limit set out in this annex, or due to the application of \nthe 10% limit applied to each item. ** At this point this is a \"hypothetical\" amount of CE T1 in that it is used only for the purposes of \ndetermining the deduction of the specified items.
